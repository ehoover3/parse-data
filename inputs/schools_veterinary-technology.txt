AHT/VT Programs in Canada

Canadian recognition
At its June 2006 meeting, the AVMA Executive Board approved a recommendation that the AVMA recommends that veterinary technician credentialing (i.e., licensing, registration, or certification) entities in the US recognize graduates of Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA)-accredited veterinary technology programs as eligible for credentialing. In turn, the CVMA recommends that Canadian provincial licensing bodies recognize graduates of AVMA-accredited veterinary technology programs as being eligible for licensure. As always, eligibility for licensure/registration/certification of veterinary technicians is the purview of each state and provincial credentialing agency.
